# Udacity-Project---Investigate-TMDb-Movie-Dataset
TMDb movies dataset: This data set contains information for about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.

## Questions we will try to answer
First question we will try to answer is: What was the most popular genres for every single year from 1960 to 2015 and my approach to answer this question will be to find the most popular movie then find its genres.

Second question will be : What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues? and we will be looking at only two properties in this analysis movies budgets and the release date of the movies.
